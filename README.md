A very generic fantasy card game with pixel art and stuff.

Press E to change the turn, and R to draw a card (this is a developer function, don't use it to cheat)

Every turn, your mana refreshes to your max mana (it is displayed as 'currentMana/maxMana' next to your player) and you draw a card.

Player1, the player who goes first, has their information displayed at the bottom right corner.

Player2, the player, who goes second, has theirs at the top right corner.

Hover over a card to see its information.

Click on a card to cast the card if it's in your hand.

Click on a creature on your side of the board to start attacking. You choose a target by clicking it. You can attack yourself or your own creatures, but that's dumb.

Your creatures are always displayed on the closer side of the board, but where your player is displayed doesn't change, so don't accidentally hit yourself. I'm gonna fix this soon, but I don't have enough time. It's pretty confusing, I know. Again, if you went first, your info is at the bottom corner and if you went second your info is in the top.

First player to 0 health loses.

Have Fun! This game only has about 10 cards currently, so give me card ideas and bug reports! Thanks for playing.
