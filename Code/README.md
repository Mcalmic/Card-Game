A very generic fantasy card game with pixel art and stuff.
Press E to go to next turn. If you press R, you will draw a card, but this is a developer function so don't use it.
First person to get to 0 life loses.
Player 1(the person who goes first) has their health and mana at the bottom.
Player 2(the person who goes second) has their health and mana at the top.
Press on a minion and then any other minion/player for them to attack. They deal damage to eachother.
A minion has to have been on the battlefield for a turn (summoning sickness) before it can attack.
You can attack yourself and your own minions, but that's stupid and I'm too lazy to patch it out.
There are only like 10 cards in the game right now, but I'll add more later.
Tell me bugs and give me card concepts. Thanks for playing!
